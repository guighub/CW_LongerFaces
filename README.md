# CW_LongerFaces
A Content Warning mod that removes the character limit, increases the text scalability, and adds text pasting (Ctrl+V) to the game.

## Notes
Everything except the text paste ability is client-side only, unless the other players also have the mod installed.

Holding backspace to delete your face text will spam a blank square character, this is normal and is a bug in the base game. I may patch it in the future, but it's not a priority at the moment.

This has not been thoroughly tested in multiplayer and some things might not work properly.

## How to install
- [Install BepInEx first](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html)
- Go to [the releases tab of this repository](https://github.com/guighub/CW_LongerFaces/releases/latest/)
- Download the latest CW_LongerFaces.dll
- Move the file to "Content Warning/BepInEx/plugins/"
- Start the game!
